I'm a second year Phd student at **Laboratoire Jean Kuntznmann** (LJK) advised by [Jérôme Malick](https://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Jerome.Malick/).

I graduated both from ENSIMAG and Université Grenoble Alpes. My degrees are in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science with a focus in the areas of Optimization, Machine Learning and Probability Theory.

I am interested in optimization problems involving uncertainty and their applications, in both stochastic programming and machine learning.

I am also in charge of the optimization reading group [GORGeous](https://sites.google.com/view/gorgeous-optim/) that happens every friday at LJK. If you are interested, feel free to contact me!
